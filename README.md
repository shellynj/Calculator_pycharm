# Calculator in Python using Pycharm

## Objective:   
For this project students will create a calculator using Python that has automated unit tests.  The calculator must perform the following operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, square, and square root.  The correct use of static methods, object methods, object attributes / properties, should be applied.   The included .csv files should be used to load data for your unit tests.  Use each file to test the associated operation.   
## Requirements:
You need to make at least 7 unit tests and should develop your tests as you write the program.  For example, you should test object instantiation when you write the code to create the object.  You must not repeat code and will lose points for any code repetition.   You should try to make a commit for each successful step you take writing the program and include a unit test with that step.

* Correct usage of object and static methods and properties
* At least 7 unit tests
* At least 7 commits
* Your program works
* Your docker file is setup to run the program
